============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
snp-sites - finds snp sites from a multi fasta alignment file

SYNOPSIS
--------
snp_sites [-mvph] [-o output_filename] [input file]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This application takes in a multi fasta alignment, finds all the SNP sites, then outputs the SNP sites in either of the following formats:

 - multi fasta alignment
 - VCF
 - relaxed phylip format

OPTIONS
-------
*-r*::
	Output internal pseudo reference sequence

*-m*::
	Output a multi fasta alignment file (default)

*-v*::
	Output a VCF file

*-p*::
	Output a phylip file

*-o*::
	Specify an output filename

*-h*::
	Show help message

*-V*::
	Show version and exit


EXAMPLES
--------

 snp-sites my-alignment.aln

 snp-sites my-gzipped-alignment.aln.gz


FORMAT OF THE INPUT FILE
------------------------

Input files should look like this:

    >reference_sequence
    aaccggtt
    >comparison_sequence
    AACCGGTT
    >another_comparison_sequence
    AACCGCTT
