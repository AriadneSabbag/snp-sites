# Installation
There are a few ways to install snp-sites. The simpliest way is using apt (Debian/Ubuntu), Conda, HomeBrew (OSX) or LinuxBrew.

* Linux - Ubuntu/Debian
* Linux - CentOS/RHEL
* Linux - using LinuxBrew
* OSX - using HomeBrew
* OSX/Linux - using Bioconda
* OSX/Linux - from source
* OSX/Linux - from a release tarball

## Linux - Ubuntu/Debian
If you have a recent version of Ubuntu or Debian then you can install it using apt.
```
   apt-get install snp-sites
```

## Linux - CentOS/RHEL
The easiest way to install on CentOS/RHEL is to use [LinuxBrew](http://brew.sh/linuxbrew/). Enable EPEL and make sure compilers are installed.
```
sudo yum install epel-release gcc gcc-c++ automake ruby-irb
```
Install [LinuxBrew](http://brew.sh/linuxbrew/).
```
brew tap homebrew/science
ln -s $(which gcc) ~/.linuxbrew/bin/gcc-4.4
ln -s $(which g++) ~/.linuxbrew/bin/g++-4.4
brew install snp-sites
```

## Linux - using LinuxBrew
Install [LinuxBrew](http://brew.sh/linuxbrew/).
```
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install snp-sites
```

## OSX - using HomeBrew
Install [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/). It requires a minimum of Xcode 5.1.1 (xcodebuild -version). Then run:
```
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install snp-sites
```

## OSX/Linux - using Bioconda
Install Conda and install the bioconda channels.
```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels r
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda install snp-sites
```


## OSX/Linux - from source
This is a difficult method and is only suitable for someone with advanced unix skills. No support is provided with this method, since you have advanced unix skills. Please consider using HomeBrew/LinuxBrew instead. First install a standard development environment (e.g. gcc, automake, autoconf, libtool). Download the software from [GitHub](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/snp-sites).

```
autoreconf -i -f
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

## OSX/Linux - from a release tarball
This is a difficult method and is only suitable for someone with advanced unix skills. No support is provided with this method, since you have advanced unix skills. Please consider using HomeBrew/LinuxBrew instead. First install a standard development environment (e.g. gcc, automake, autoconf, libtool).

```
tar xzvf snp-sites-x.y.z.tar.gz
cd snp-sites-x.y.z
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

## All platforms - Docker
Bioconda produce a Docker container so you can use the software out of the box. Install Docker and then pull the container from Bioconda https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/snp-sites
